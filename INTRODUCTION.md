- Ease-of-use and normalization encourage broader testing (researchers test their algorithms on more datasets).
- Ease-of-use and normalization encourage prior art reviews (researchers try more existing algorithms on new datasets).
- Large collections enable massive ML models.
- A fundamental trade-off (flexibility for dataset producers, rigidity for dataset consumers).
- Readily useful for:
    - data prediction
    - compression benchmarks
    - statistical analysis
    - pattern recognition (the file name is the ground truth)
    - frame generation
- Question of ground truth not addressed yet for other problems (in particular tracking).

- Streaming: generally convenient, particularly important for Neuromorphic hardware
